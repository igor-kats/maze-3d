- [x] Ensure maze connectivity (start to exit paths)
- [x] Add crossroads for navigation variety
- [x] Random exit placement on maze edges
- [x] Starting area creation (3x3 cleared space)

**Deliverable**: `01_maze_generator.gd` - Fully functional maze generation script

#### ✅ Milestone 1.2: 3D Maze Rendering
- [x] 3D mesh generation for walls, floor, and exit
- [x] Material system (gray walls, dark floor, glowing exit)
- [x] Collision detection setup for walls
- [x] Configurable parameters (wall height, cell size, thickness)
- [x] Dynamic maze clearing and regeneration
- [x] World coordinate mapping functions

**Deliverable**: `02_maze_renderer.gd` - Complete 3D maze visualization system

## Current Development Status

### 🏃‍♂️ **Active Tasks**
1. Setting up proper Godot scene structure
2. Attaching scripts to nodes correctly
3. Adding Camera3D for first-person view
4. Performance testing on different hardware

### 🚧 **Known Issues**
- Performance concerns on lower-end hardware (51x51 maze = ~2,600 wall objects)
- Renderer script node path dependency (`../MazeGenerator`)  
- No player controller yet (only maze visualization)

### 🎯 **Next Immediate Steps**
1. **Scene Setup**: Complete proper node structure and script attachment
2. **Camera Addition**: Add Camera3D for viewing the maze
3. **Performance Testing**: Test maze generation with smaller grid sizes
4. **Player Controller**: Begin implementing first-person movement
